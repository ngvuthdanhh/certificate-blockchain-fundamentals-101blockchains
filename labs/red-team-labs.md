# Red Team Labs â€” Offensive Blockchain Exploration

### Objective
Understand blockchain-specific attack surfaces and offensive techniques to strengthen your ability to test and evaluate smart contract and network security.

### Lab 1: Smart Contract Exploitation
- Exploit a reentrancy vulnerability in a demo smart contract.  
- Use Remix IDE and MetaMask testnet.  
- Goal: drain funds from the contract via fallback function abuse.

### Lab 2: 51% Attack Simulation
- Set up a small private blockchain (Ganache or custom private network).  
- Run two nodes and perform a simulated majority hash-power attack.  
- Goal: demonstrate double-spending and the importance of decentralization.

### Lab 3: Fake Wallet & Phishing Analysis
- Collect samples of fake crypto wallet interfaces.  
- Analyze domain chains and detect phishing indicators.  
- Goal: identify social engineering techniques used in crypto scams.
