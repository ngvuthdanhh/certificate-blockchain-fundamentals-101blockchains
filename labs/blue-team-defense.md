# Blue Team Defense â€” Defensive Blockchain Practices

### Objective
Apply security best practices and perform defensive operations to secure blockchain applications and infrastructure.

### Lab 1: Smart Contract Security Audit
- Detect logic flaws and vulnerabilities (overflow, access control, reentrancy).  
- Use static analysis tools like Slither or Mythril (in simulation mode).  
- Goal: identify and document vulnerabilities before deployment.

### Lab 2: Secure Wallet Management
- Create and back up wallets; test small transactions.  
- Evaluate hardware wallets, multisig, and cold storage methods.  
- Goal: understand secure key and wallet management.

### Lab 3: Node Hardening
- Configure an Ethereum node with firewall and updated dependencies.  
- Secure RPC endpoints and disable public exposure.  
- Goal: prevent unauthorized access and DDoS attacks on blockchain nodes.
