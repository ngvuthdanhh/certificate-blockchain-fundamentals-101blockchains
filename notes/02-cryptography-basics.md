# 02 â€” Cryptography Basics

**Learning goals:**  
Understand the core cryptographic techniques that make blockchain secure.

**Topics covered:**  
- Hashing algorithms (SHA-256, Keccak-256).  
- Symmetric vs. asymmetric cryptography.  
- Digital signatures and message integrity.  
- Public/private key management.

**Exercise:**  
Compute a SHA-256 hash of a message and verify that even small changes alter the output drastically.
