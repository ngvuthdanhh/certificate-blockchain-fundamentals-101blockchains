# Research Overview — Blockchain Fundamentals

### Purpose
To encourage students and professionals to explore academic and technical research in blockchain technology — from consensus algorithms and smart contracts to decentralized governance and scalability.

### Research Focus Areas
1. Consensus mechanisms and their evolution (PoW, PoS, BFT, DAGs).  
2. Blockchain scalability — sharding, rollups, and sidechains.  
3. Privacy-preserving technologies — ZKP, MPC, confidential transactions.  
4. Smart contract verification and security.  
5. Governance models and tokenomics.  
6. Blockchain interoperability and cross-chain protocols.  
7. Real-world adoption and sustainability.
